\section{Introduction}
This report seeks to analyze virus outbreaks on a global scale. More specifically, the primary focus will be to analyze how fast a virus spreads and how many people it infects as a function of 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item infection/cure rates
	\item travel frequencies
	\item Initial virus location
\end{enumerate}
. In addition it will be examined how a big event like the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 could affect an outbreak.

Because no closed form solution model of the above system exists this report will be based on stochastic simulation of the system
