\section{Introduction}
This report seeks to analyze virus epidemic on a global scale. More specifically, the primary focus will be to analyze how fast a virus spreads and how many people it infects. In particular it will be examined, how a big event like the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 could affect an epidemic.

Because of the many model uncertainties, such as traviling behaviour, infection rate, etc. and the sudden behavioral change associated with the Olympic Games, a stochastic simulation model is created.
