\section{Modelling}
This report seeks to model the time evolution of a virus outbreak on earth. To do, firstly it will be described how one might model a virus outbreak in small uniform population. Secondly, this model will be expanded to include multiple population groups and their interactions. 

\subsection{The SIR Model}
\todo{cite stuff in this section}
\subsubsection{Assumption}
The Susceptible-Infected-Removed model is compartmental model assuming that within some subdivision of the population containing $N$ individuals, virus infection, cure and spread rates are i.i.d. for the 3 "compartments" of individuals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Susceptible to the virus
	\item Infected by the virus
	\item Recovered and immune to the virus (or alternatively dead)
\end{itemize} 
. In reality economic status, job type, air-conditioning etc. will affect how a virus spread, however, depending on the heterogeneity of the population these assumptions constitute a good approximation. 

\subsubsection{Governing equations}
The SIR model is governed by 3 differential equations,
\begin{align}
\frac{d S(t)}{dt} &= - \frac{\beta}{N} I(t) S(t)   \label{eq-S}\\
\frac{d I(t)}{dt} &= \frac{\beta}{N} I(t) S(t) - \gamma I(t)  \label{eq-I}\\
\frac{d R(t)}{dt} &= \gamma I(t) \label{eq-R}
\end{align}
where $S(t), I(t)$ and $R(t)$ are functions describing the number of susceptible, infected and removed individuals at time t, $\beta$ is the rate of infection, $\gamma$ the rate of cure and $N$ the total number of individuals.

From equation \eqref{eq-S} and one \eqref{eq-I} can see that susceptible individuals become infected by some ratio proportional to $\beta$ and the ratio of already infected/susceptible individuals. From \eqref{eq-I} and \eqref{eq-R} one can see that infected individuals recover with a constant time factor.

\subsection{Multi-region SIR}
Let it now be given that instead of having a single population, one has $K$ populations each with initial $N_k(0), S_k(0), I_k(0)$ and $R_k(0)$. Each of these populations have a probability of transferring individuals to other populations regardless of whether the individual is susceptible, infected or recovered. The governing equations are modified to add the transfers and become
\begin{align}
\frac{d S_k(t)}{dt} &= - \frac{\beta}{N} I(t) S(t) + \sum_{i\in K} \left( S_i(t)\tau_{i,k} - s_k(t)\tau_{k, i}\right)   &\forall k\\
\frac{d I_k(t)}{dt} &= \frac{\beta}{N} I(t) S(t) - \gamma I(t) + \sum_{i\in K} \left( I_i(t)\tau_{i,k} - I_k(t)\tau_{k, i}\right)  &\forall k\\
\frac{d R_k(t)}{dt} &= \gamma I(t) + \sum_{i\in K} \left( R_i(t)\tau_{i,k} - R_k(t)\tau_{k, i}\right) &\forall k
\end{align}
, where $\tau_{i,j}$ is the infinitesimal probability of transferring from population $i$ to $j$ per individual. 

As an example of the above system let $K=3$ and the non zero transfer probabilities be defined by the graph:
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}

\def \n {3}
\def \radius {2cm}
\def \margin {12} % margin in angles, depends on the radius

\foreach \s in {1,...,\n}
{
	\node[draw, circle] at ({360/\n * (\s - 1)}:\radius) {$\s$};
	\draw[->, >=latex] ({360/\n * (\s - 1)+\margin}:\radius) 
	arc ({360/\n * (\s - 1)+\margin}:{360/\n * (\s)-\margin}:\radius);
}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
. Solving this system numerically with the outbreak starting in region 1 one gets the following curves
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width= 1.0 \linewidth]{plots/sir_three_region.pdf}
	\caption{Numerical solution to the nonlinear ODE system defining a 3-region SIR model.}
\end{figure}
. From the above plot we see that the virus first spreads fast in region 1. After a certain time a enough infected individuals have been transferred to region 2 where the infection then accelerates. This continues to region 3.
