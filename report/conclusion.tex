\section{Conclusion}
This report extended the deterministic SIR-model to a multi-region stochastic SIR-model. The model was tested on a small example to validate that it accurately reflects the SIR-model. Using real population and region connection data a hypothetical virus outbreak originating in Rio de Janeiro was simulated. Both through estimated key figures such as peak infection times and peak infection amounts and visual inspection of animations it was shown the that hosting the Olympic Games in a region with a virus outbreak can significantly speed up the outbreak.
